HangingChad ===========

HangingChad is a voting plugin for Rails.  It solves a lot of issues I had with
acts_as_voteable.


Install =======

    script/plugin install git://github.com/nabewise/hanging_chad.git

    script/generate hanging_chad

The generator creates the Vote and VoteTotal models which keep track of the
votes


Usage =====

To set up a model that can be voted for just use 'has_votes'

    class Review < ActiveRecord::Base 
      has_votes 
    end

HangingChad supports models having votes for multiple named attributes
    
    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base 
      has_votes_for :insightfulness
      has_votes_for :controversy 
    end

Recording a vote for a Review would work like

    @review.record_vote(user, true)

or

    @review.record_vote(user, false)

Recording a vote for a Comment would work like

    @comment.record_vote(user, true, :insightfulness)
    
Other methods of interest are

Instance Methods:

total_votes(kind=nil) -- number of votes aye_votes(kind=nil) -- number of aye
  votes 
nay_votes(kind=nil) -- number of nay votes 
percent_aye_votes(kind=nil)
percent_nay_votes(kind=nil)

vote_from_user(user, kind=nil) -- true = user has voted aye, false = user has
  voted nay, nil = user has not voted 
user_voted?(user, kind=nil) -- has the user voted?

Class Methods:

sort_by_votes(kind=nil) -- returns collection sorted by votes
include_votes_by_user(user) -- returns a collection with all the users votes
  joined in to prevent excess database queries on vote_from_user or user_voted?
  (useful for displaying lists of things with the current_user's votes visible).
